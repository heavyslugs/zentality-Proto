University students are in a highly transitional period of their lives. In addition to taking a full course load, many students are also working full-time jobs, taking care of families, and learning how to be independent. Since mental health is often a taboo subject, the team saw a need to offer University of Cincinnati (UC) students an anonymous way of journaling their daily mental health and perform data analysis on it so they can visualize patterns in their mental behavior. </p>\n    <br>\n    <h3>Our Solution:</h3>\n    <p>Zentality allows students to securely keep a log of their thoughts and feelings, and see patterns in their entries over time. In addition to this, students will also have access to a page of common mental health disorders, symptoms, and a list of resources with which they can follow up in order to take action on seeking additional help, should they choose to do so. The long-term, overarching goals of the application are to help break down the barriers and stigmas associated with mental health, promote a platform where UC students can each <strong>individually empower themselves to take control of their own respective mental health.</strong> Hopefully, more and more students will normalize the discussion of their mental health and take it into serious consideration as they do their physical health.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"container aboutus\">\n    <h1>About Us</h1>\n    <p class=\"lead\">The team at Zentality is devoted to empowering students to be in charge of their own mental healths.
